Well done!

All is correct, but I have a proposition about filter-buttons. 
It's not really a good way to create a whole new page for filtered graphs.
With gender we can leave it as it is.
But for age category: you can simply replace these shapes with horizontal filter - it will look totally the same. To do so, create a filter by age category, go to format -> visual -> slicer settings -> options -> orientation:horizontal.

Mark: 10-3=7
