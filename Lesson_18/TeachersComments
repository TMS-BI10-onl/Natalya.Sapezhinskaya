Test notes: 
KPI Number of films - it should be count(distinct) - then the number will be correct.
Also, it was mentioned that it needed to be one page with 2 views.
What is a better filter for last 25 years: create a filter by release_date (not release date year), select relative date filtering and then type "in the last 25 years".
